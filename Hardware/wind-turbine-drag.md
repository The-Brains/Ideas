## Idea

### Description

I am no expert in thermodynamic but I remember learning about this drag area at the back
of vehicules. At this location, the wind is doing like a little tornado. Why not use
this area to harvest wind and get back some power ? 

## Use cases

* Take advantage of the drag area.
* Reduce the negative effects of drag.
