### Description

Would be awesome to be able to harvest the water from the air, specialy in foggy area like London or San Francisco.
Imagine a mesh system tied between buildings. The top of the mesh will be cold with the wind going through it. The bottom
will be warmer, closer form the cars. This temperature difference can create electricity. Plus the colder temperature going
through the mesh toward the warmer area can create condensation. If the mesh material is a good thermal conducter and hollow,
that could work very well. The hollow mesh could also carry the water to the buildings it is hang on. 

## Use cases

* Harvesting water from thin air, it is more efficient that from the salty ocean.
