## Status: BRAINSTORMING

## Idea

### Description

The same way you can lease a car instead of owning it. You would be able to lease a phone or a laptop.
The company will keep the image of your system in the servers and everytime you change device you get your
system image restored.

## Use cases

* So you always have the latest model of a device
* So you don't have to buy a new phone every year
