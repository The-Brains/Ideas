## Idea

### Description

The idea is to have a service on demand ( where workers are paid per job instead of full-time ) for companies
who wants data to train machine learning algorithm. In today's world of the information revolution, the
demand for data is getting bigger and bigger and companies struggle to find reliable source of data
for their machine learning algorithms. This company could fulfill this gap.

## Use cases

* A company needs transcript for 100 000 audio files to train a language machine learning algorithm, 
we could leverage our thousands of workers to listen and enter the transcript manually.
* A company needs photos of landscape labeled with presence of flowers and trees. We could ask the workers 
to take the photos as well as label them.

For each of those examples, each input is cross checked with several workers to make sure of the accuracy of the
results. This allow to automatically score the performance of the workers. 
Also, this architecture can be used to collect more data, like dashcams video for self driving cars. As well as,
getting information of what is the human-level-error for a given situation.
