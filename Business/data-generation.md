## Idea

### Description

Imagine a company where maching learning labs ( from big company or start up or labs ) 
can ask for labeled dataset of anything.
You want to order 1 millions photos of montagne, you want 500 000 photos of dogs, 
you want recording of people talking, you want noise of bars, you want noise of broken car engines,
you want anything, labeled, just order it on this platform. And it can be charged per sample, like for 
the 1 millions image of montagne, it can be 0.1 cents per photo. 
And to collect those photos, the company would get people "Uber-like" to submit their photos and the'll be 
rewarded 0.01 cents per valid submition.
