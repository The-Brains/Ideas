## Idea

### Description

The idea is you pay a monthly fee and then if you go to jail, the company will pay to bail you out.
You can pay more monthly and you will get a lawyer covered by the company. 

## Use cases

* The jail system works only for the rich, if you have money you can ignore the law. That will smooth that out.
