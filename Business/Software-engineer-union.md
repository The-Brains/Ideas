### Description

The idea is to create a union like other workers can have. 
In today's century, software engineers are the workforce and the blue colar of the industry.
The union would make sure that all software engineers have good and equitable opportunities,
good benefits, good salary, good life balance, etc....

## Use cases

Few ideas:
* Make sure that all software engineers get free 100% health insurrance, vision covers
* Make sure that all software engineers get opportunities to improve and learn more

* We could have a platform working as a DAO where every member can vote on the next goals.
* Also, transparency would be key, like having a real time counter of the money available and the expenses.
