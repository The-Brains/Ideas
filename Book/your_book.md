## Idea

### Description

The idea is to have a book written like if a GM told you what is happenning to you. Something like:

```
"hello", you say to the guy
"hello", the guy respond to you
```

Also it would even be possible/fun to leave some of "yours" answer blank, like:

```
"hello", the guy say to you
"_____ ____ ___ ___", you respond to the guy

```

## Use cases

* Immersive story but not as hard to write as "book where you're the hero".
