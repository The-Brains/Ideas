## Idea

### Description

Classic dating apps have profiles that often contains text, photos, etc...
Imagine you split this up and what you swipe left/right on are the profile parts instead of the entire profile.
And once you have swip on 2+ parts you match with the complete profile. 

## Use cases

* just a different kind of dating app.
