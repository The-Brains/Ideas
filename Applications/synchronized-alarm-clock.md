## Idea

### Description

Imagine an app install on all your devices.
You set an alarm on one of them.
All your devices will ring ! 
You stop one, they all stop. 

### Use cases

* You forgot your phone at home and it rings but you are not there to turn it off
* Your phone is not with you, you set up the alarm from your laptop
* Your laptop / phone / etc.. will all ring at the morning, pretty sure you'll wake up ! 
* If we build up a protocol, we can sync with traditional alarm clock too:
** So if you are not at home you can set up your alarm from your phone
