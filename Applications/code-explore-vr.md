# Code Exploration in VR

## Original Author: Leo Benkel

## Status: BRAINSTORMING

## Idea

### Description

Imagine you could teleport inside your code. 
Instead of reading files you would be able to climb and follow method calls.
You see one method, you can grab into a rope of light and code to its definition and you can look around and see all those threads going back and forth and you can grab them with your hands and follow them. 

## Use cases

* Visualize complex source code
* Debugging
* Refactoring
