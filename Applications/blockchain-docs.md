### Description

What if we use a blockchain technology to build a system where anyone can upload and search for documents anonymously. 
I watched the movie about Wikileaks and the main issue seemed to be the centralization of the decision.
If we have a decentralize system for document, anyone could access or submit document, then journalist can decide what 
to do with each of them or if there are even real. There are a lot of brainstorming to do and a lot of dangerouse use cases 
to be careful about.

## Use cases

* whisle blower
* a document vault
* no central server, storage which will never go down
