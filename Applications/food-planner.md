### Description

Imagine an app / website where you can select what you have in your pantries ( in v2 you could scan the barcode with your phone ). 
Once your pantry is saved , you can drag and drop what you have to specific days. 
In v2 you can also suggest recipes when you don't have ideas. To fill the days for you with what is left.
