# Take note on github

## Original Author: Leo Benkel

## Status: BRAINSTORMING

## Idea

### Description

Build an example app to use the [githubDB library](https://github.com/The-Brains/GithubDB).
This would be a note taking app.
To use it, enter your Auth Token from github account / username / name of storage repo. 
Those information will be store in the client side localstorage.
Then we can use the GithubDB library to store and retreive your notes. 

## Use cases

* Show case githubDB.
