### Description

Imagine a service where the entry point is just an email. 
From gmail you will be able to set up an automatic forward to 
real-estate-assistant@realEstateAssistant.com and a machine learning 
will be able to fetch the tax document , monthly statement, and 
notify you when you receive an email that you have to treat yourself.
To teach it who can have a system where you tell the bot where to click or 
what information is important in a given email. It will learn from all the people
training it. 

## Use cases

* handle harvesting tax documents
* handle monthly statement
* handle HOW emails
* In the future, could automate some of the email exchange during property purchase.
