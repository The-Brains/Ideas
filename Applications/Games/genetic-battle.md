## Idea
### Description

The idea would be mix of those simulation with generation of cars which race as far as possible generation after generation,
mixed with Spore. And mixed with this game Impossible Creature.
And you can make your creature battle and breed them to get the best combination possible.

## Use cases

* Just a fun game
* You could have a offline mode where your creature fight each other while you're offline.
