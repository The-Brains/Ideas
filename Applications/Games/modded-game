# Modded Game

## Original Author: Leo Benkel

## Status: BRAINSTORMING

## Idea

### Description

This would be a game with nothing, completely empty. Just a fresh canvas. 
To make a game you will have to download mods and make this game your own.

## Use cases

* You want to download a pack of weapons from the year 3000, do it.
* You want monsters from the deep of Hell, sure, why not.
* You want a RPG or a hack'n'slash ? Up to you !
