# MMO No Trinity

### Description

In every MMO, there is always the trinity of Healer, Tank, DPS. I am tired of it. I want a game without that.
I have several ideas on how to break it that I will write here. 

First, we could focus more on Crowd Control than on tanking. You need to stunt, root the enemy so nobody get hurt. 

Second, there should not be classes. The more you use a spell, the better it becomes. 
Kind of like in Elder Scroll Online. However, everyone should have access to everything.
Then there will be a critical item, call it whatever but it would have the fonction of a spell book.
For instance you would have a spell book which allow for 3 dps spell, 1 wildcard and 2 heal spell. 
You could have an other spell boook with 2 crowd control, 2 heal and 1 wildcard. etc...
The quantity of each category of spell can change as well as the overall quantity of spell. 
This spell book will be your action bar. You could even have level limitation. 
Like a spellbook with spell no more than level 5. Or 3 spells level 5 and 2 spell level 10. 

## Use cases

* More diverse type of characters
* No defined role like DPS, Tank, Heal.
