## Idea

### Description

A MMO or RTS game where you control a virus / bacteria / prion / ... , similar to 'Plague,Inc' but more "hands on",
like 'Spore'. You could start in a puddle or stagnant water, take advantage of other disease to progress, 
learn how to propagate through air, or water, or touch, and from species to species. Maybe start as a mosquitos virus,
or as a pet disease before switching to human, etc... You'll also have to equip defense against antibodies, medecine, etc..

## Use cases

* Just a cool game where you try to grow as a uni cellular organism.
