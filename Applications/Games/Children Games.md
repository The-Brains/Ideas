Children Games

Status: BRAINSTORMING

Idea
A game to bring out people's nostalgia, collecting games that people used to play as kids.

Description
This is a game that compiles several mini-games. The game should be multiplayer, but might not have to be real-time.
The game's style is a bit dream, reminiscent of childhood. The intro screen is a shadow scene of children dancing around,
singing a [children's song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMvItn2lpbk).

Each mini-game is a recreation of one of the kid's game that we used to play in preschool.

- [La Marelle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GWPhrfoWoY) (Hopscotch)
- [123 Soleil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VxGP1m7T1A) (grandma's footsteps)
- [La Patate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_4_1geTTAI) (Spud)
- Marbles
- The game where you tap on cards to flip them
- Jump rope
- Cache-cache (hide and seek)
- Colin-maillard
- Chat (Tag)

We'll also have various animations of [kid's clapping hands](https://www.todaysparent.com/family/10-classic-hand-clapping-games-to-teach-your-kid/)
The goal is to provide an ambiance of being a kid again in the 90's. (so no modern games like paintball or catching pokemons...)

We'll have some leaderboards and social components to let players see their friends playing. We don't
want to give a sense of lost nostalgia, but we want to make adults feel like they can play with their friends
as kids again. Also, kids playing this game will have an insight about what people used to play before we
had video games.
