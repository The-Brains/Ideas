Language Game

This idea is to provide an educational game that will help children as well as adults learn new language.
Most educational games are mostly disasters, and not fun for kids. With this language game, we're taking a different approach.

Games: FUN
Educational: LEARN NEW LANGUAGE

One of the defects of educational games, is that it is very obvious that the game is trying to teach you something.
Already, you're feeling like a mechanical version of school, and the brain shuts off...

To counter that, our game will be primarily fun. The learning will come from overcoming challenge, yet it will never
feel like a homework or a school lesson.

The language is is basically going to be an open world.
You start in an area of your choice (mainly your own language). As you encounter people, you can communicate with them,
asking questions, making requests, ect...

Some of the options when talking with other people will be completely ridiculous. For example,
You go to a restaurant. You can order:
- Pasta
- Chicken
- A shiny shoe
- A Dinosaure
- ect...

If you order a dinosaure, the waiter will look at you in confusion, then try to match your request. You're gonna end up
with a dinosaure on your plate.

You're going to wonder, what does this have anything to do with learning new language.
Well, we are just going to recreate a similar world, but in a completely different language. So let's say in French, you're
at a restaurant and order:
- Un bon steak bien saignant
- Un bonne biere bien fraiche
- Un bonhomme de neige
- Une bouse de vache bien fraiche

We are not going to put the stupid options last. We will mix them up.
So for someone unfamiliar with the language, they are as likely to end up with a nice beer, or a delicious chocolate mousse
coming out of a cow's behind.
It's going to be funny, but at the same time they will learn some new words.

This is just one example, but we can see how we can expand this experience to:
- Going to the store
- Travelling
- Visiting a museum
- Working
- Going to school
- Playing sports

We're basically replicating the experience of being in a different country, inside a game. We're providing exploration, and
at the same time, a great learning experience.
