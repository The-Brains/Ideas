### Description

A FPS game where the only weapons are mines, trap, laser mines, etc...

You would have a colddown for each, and a bubble around mine where you can't put an other one but
there are no ammunition.

You can earn point to increas the radius / damage / etc...

There can be coop modes, or capture the flag. 

It is even possible to have turn based game where the first team place all the traps then the other one 
run to the objective dodging the traps.

Ideas for weapons/trap/tools:
* laser mine
* laser moving mine
* ground mine with radius on the floor
* scanner mine with movement detection trigger
* smoke to see the laser better
* rocks to trigger the mines from afar

Ideas for kind of game:
* classic deathmatch / free for all
* team deathmatch
* team turn based , objective ( capture the flag ) 
* capture the flag , but you don't see the players from the other team ( you can't place a mine in a radius around a player )
* Construction level, you place all the trap, and publish it to the world, and you can play them solo. Time score / death score ? 

## Use cases

* Have fun :)
