### Description

Imagine a game which equipped with machine learning is learning how you play.
As you progress in the game, in a horror Cthulhu universe, the game will 
sometimes take over and play to game for you. The goal is for the player,
not to realize that he is not entirely in control of his action. The goal
is to make it in a way which would show case the Cthulhu universe, in which,
humans are irrelevant, your action won't change the outcome. Cthlhu is here
whether you like or not !

## Use cases

* The first Cthulhu game which won't give Cthulhu a life bar !
* You cannot hurt Cthulhu
* You are not in control
