### Description

It would be a game where you are the leader of a roman army (maybe Ceasar, why not?)
And make it as realistic as possible in term of logistic:
How do you order your front line to go to point A when you are few kilometers away? 
You need to give a note to a messenger or make signals to the front line.
You would see the first person view as the leader. 
You can move to the front line yourself but risk being killed.
You also need to manage the logistic or transporting your troups from battle to battle, set up camp, provide food and paycheck to your troups.
