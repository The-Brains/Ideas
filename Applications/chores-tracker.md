### Description

An App where you can create a group ( friends, couple, etc... ). 
When you create the group, you can list several chores you want to keep track of (dishes, vacuum, laundry, etc...).
You give each some points (dishes: 2, laundry: 5, etc... )
Then everyone in the group can mark one chores as done and the rest of the group can validate it by Thanking them. 
You create a rewarding way for the chores, you earn points and get thanked by the people it benefits.
You can also imagine the score like a credit score, when you apply to an appartment as a roommate they can look you up. 

## Use cases
