What if you could team up with someone from an other discipline to get your phd.
All parties would share the same phd diploma. They could split the cost, etc... 
And allow more wide phd subjet.

## Use cases

* More broad phd subjet like: Genetic and machine learning, computer science and history, social economy and biology, etc...
